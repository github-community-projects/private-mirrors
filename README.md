The Private Mirrors App (PMA) is GitHub App that allows you to work on contributions to an upstream open source project using a private repository in your own organization. This is useful for developing and checking contributions internally before making any commits publicly visible.

## Problem Statement

Enterprises struggle with how to let their developers contribute to open source projects. Most are not opposed, in principle, to contributing back to the projects they rely upon. Many are enthusiastic about becoming better open source citizens, and understand the reputational and technical benefits that working in open source can accrue to the business. However, real and perceived security concerns make this process difficult at best and impossible at worst for companies.

To succeed, open source advocates and OSPOs need to address their stakeholders' concerns about:

- Credential leaks
- Intellectual property leaks
- PII / PHI disclosure
- Liability and/or reputational damage resulting from bad code

Addressing these concerns creates opportunities for enterprise development teams to participate more deeply in open source and foster a collaborative relationship with the open source community.

> The Private Mirrors App (PMA) is a GitHub App paired with a UI that manages the lifecycle of private mirrors, as well as the synchronization of code between the public fork of an upstream project and the private mirrors where the enterprise teams are working.

## Key Features

- Piggybacks off native GitHub fork network functionality to allow you to contribute to an upstream project using a private repository in your own organization
- No commit rewriting â€” keep commit history, author attributions, commit signing and other metadata intact
- No datastore â€” no need to worry about storing your code on a third-party server
- Reduces risk of making open source contributions to upstream projects because your work stays private until it passes approval
- Adapt the app to your workflow to ensure approvals, checks, and other requirements are met before code is merged upstream
- Works with GitHub Enterprise Managed Users (EMUs) and GitHub Enterprise Cloud (GHEC)

High Level Flow:

![Time-series diagram showing work starting upstream, moving into a public fork, and through PMA into a private mirror](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3bb12563-dd32-46cc-b5cb-e983e9edd089)

The app uses an intermediary public fork to merge the private mirror into, and then enables the normal OSS contributor workflow into the upstream repository. This allows users to keep the private repo private while still allowing us to contribute to the upstream repository. Check out this [application flow diagram](./docs/architecture.md) for a more detailed look at how the app works.

## Hosting

You'll need to self-host the app. See the section on [Developing](docs/developing.md) for more information.

This app was created with the idea of self-hosting in mind and can be deployed to any hosting provider that supports Next.js/Docker.

Configuration is contained in a `.env` file which you'll need to customize for your environment. Use the `.env.example` in the root of this repository as a starting point. In particular, you'll need to set the following:

- `PUBLIC_ORG` and `PRIVATE_ORG` environment variables if you want to keep your private mirrors in a different GitHub organization from the public forks
- `ALLOWED_HANDLES` variable to a comma-separated list of GitHub user handles which ought to be allowed to access the app to create mirrors. If unset, all users who are members of the organization will be allowed to use the app.

```sh
docker build -t private-mirrors .
docker run --env-file=.env -p 3000:3000 private-mirrors

# alternatively, you can use docker compose
docker compose up
```

We recommend using Node 20.x or higher, though any Node LTS version >18 should work.

Once it's running, you'll need to create a GitHub App and configure it to point to your deployment. See the [Developing â€” GitHub App](docs/developing.md#github-app) section for more information.

## Integrating the App into GHEC

The app can be integrated into GitHub Enterprise Cloud (GHEC) by following the same steps as GitHub.com. The app is designed to work with GHEC and GitHub Enterprise Managed Users (EMUs).

The only tradeoff is that a single app instance will only work between a single GitHub instance and a single GHEC instance. If you have multiple GitHub instances and GHEC instances, you will need to deploy multiple instances of the app.

To enable the app to work with GHEC, you will need to set the following environment variables in addition to installing the App on your GHEC organization instance.

```sh
PUBLIC_ORG=name-of-your-public-org    # Where your public forks will be created
PRIVATE_ORG=name-of-your-ghec-org     # Where your private mirrors will be created
```

The authentication of the UI will still need to be a user's github.com user, but the app will be able to create forks and mirrors in the GHEC instance.

## Usage

Once the app is installed, follow this document on [Using the Private Mirrors App](docs/using-the-app.md) to get the repository fork and mirrors set up for work.
